What, you thought I was joking?

## Setup

### Running on heroku
Putting setup in a rake task as `heroku:configure`, but notes below as to what to do manually.

#### Setup config variables

    heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi.git

#### Setup periodic tasks

    heroku addons:add scheduler:standard
    heroku addons:open scheduler

Then schedule `ruby blahblah` to run every 10 minutes.


### local development
Remember you'll need `pdftotext` installed somewhere in your path.  Use a `.env` file to hold config variables.
